In python there are two category's of Data Structures available.

# Built In:
1. List
2. Tuple
3. Set
4. Dictionary

# User Defined:
1. Stack
2. Queue
3. Linked List
4. Tree
5. Graph

# List:
1. We can store different types of data in list. it can be int or string.
2. List maintained its order.
3. List can be access using indexing. ex: List = [0]
4. Negative indexing in list gives previous values of called index. ex: [-2]
5. List can be nested. means we declare different value in one list. ex: [[1,3], 1,4]
6. List are dynamic. Though, its mutable, value will shrinks after delete or add

# Tuple:
1. Similar to list which also store data.
2. To declare tuple value we have to use parentheses and for single value we have to comma after the value. ex: tuple = (1,)
3. We can't change or modify tuple after creating it.We can't insert element neither delete any element or value.
4. We use tuple because its faster then Lists and it can't be modified.

# Dictionary:
1. Dictionary is for storing data using values in key and values key:values pairs bounded with second bracket. ex: dic = {"x": 1, "y":2}
2. Keys and values are spread by colon and each pair of keys and values spread by comma.
3. Keys must be constant but values can be change.
4. From Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered but it was unordered in Python 3.6 and earlier.
5. It can't be nested.

# Sets:
1. Its a collection of unique elements. We can't have duplicate values in sets.
2. If we use duplicate value it will ignore that value.
3. Sets can contain only immutable types value.
4. Sets can't be nested.
